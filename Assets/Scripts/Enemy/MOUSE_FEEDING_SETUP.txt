# Mouse of Death - Enemy Feeding System Setup

## Overview
This system allows the Mouse of Death boss to chase and eat Cactus Enemies to regain health when damaged. When the Mouse's health drops below a threshold, it will hunt for cactus enemies while continuing to attack the player.

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Tag the Cactus Enemies
1. Select all Cactus Enemy prefabs in your project
2. In the Inspector, set their Tag to "CactusEnemy" (create this tag if it doesn't exist)

### 2. Configure the Mouse of Death Boss
1. Select the "Mouse of Death" prefab
2. Add the "BossEnemyFeed" component from the Add Component menu
3. Configure the component settings:

   **Feeding Settings:**
   - Detection Radius: 15 (how far the Mouse can detect cactus enemies)
   - Target Enemy Tag: "CactusEnemy"
   - Health Gain Amount: 10 (amount of health gained per cactus eaten)
   - Feed Cooldown: 1.5 (seconds between eating cactus enemies)
   - Show Detection Radius: true (for debugging)
   - Detection Radius Color: Green (for visualization in the Scene view)

   **State Management:**
   - Health Threshold To Feed: 0.7 (start feeding when below 70% health)
   - Return To Fight Threshold: 0.9 (return to fighting the player when above 90% health)

### 3. Ensure Proper Collider Setup
1. The Mouse of Death should have a Collider2D component (probably already has one)
2. Make sure this collider is set to "Is Trigger" or add a separate trigger collider
3. Cactus Enemies should also have their own colliders

### 4. Playtest and Fine-tune
1. Test the boss fight and observe when the Mouse of Death takes damage
2. When below 70% health, it should start seeking cactus enemies WHILE still shooting at the player
3. After eating enough to reach 90% health, it should return to exclusively focusing on the player
4. Adjust the Health Gain Amount if needed - it should be balanced so the boss gets a slight advantage but isn't invincible

## Boss Behavior
- The Mouse of Death will continue to shoot at the player while chasing cactus enemies
- This creates a challenging dynamic where the player must dodge attacks while also trying to prevent the boss from healing
- The boss prioritizes movement toward cactus enemies when in feeding mode, but still maintains its attack pattern

## Troubleshooting

If the Mouse is not eating cactus enemies:
1. Verify that cactus enemies have the correct "CactusEnemy" tag
2. Make sure the colliders are properly set up on both the Mouse and cactus enemies
3. Check the Detection Radius setting - it may be too small
4. Confirm that the Mouse of Death has the EnemyHealth, EnemyPathfinding, and EnemyAI components

If the Mouse is gaining too much health:
1. Reduce the Health Gain Amount setting
2. Increase the Feed Cooldown to make feeding slower
3. Adjust the Return To Fight Threshold to make it return to the player sooner
