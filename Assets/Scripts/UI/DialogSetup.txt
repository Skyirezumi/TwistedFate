DIALOG SYSTEM SETUP GUIDE

Follow these steps to set up the dialog system for Gecco's boss spawning:

1. Dialog Container Setup:
   - Select the "Dialog Container" GameObject in your scene hierarchy
   - Make sure it has a Canvas Group component (Add one if missing)
   - Ensure it has a TextMeshProUGUI component for text display
   - Add the DialogManager script to this GameObject

2. GeccoInteraction Script Configuration:
   - In the Gecco NPC's Inspector, find the GeccoInteraction component
   - Under "Dialog Settings", drag the Dialog Container GameObject to the "Dialog Container" field
   - Under "Boss Settings", configure the boss-dialog pairs:
     * Click the "+" button to add a new boss-dialog pair for each boss
     * For each pair, drag a boss prefab to the "Boss Prefab" field
     * Enter the dialog text you want to show when that boss is spawned
     * Example pairs:
       - Mouse of Death: "You Fucked up son... I released the Mouse of Death!"
       - Scorpion of Death: "The Scorpion of Death has been summoned!"
       - Goldfish of Death: "You're gonna need a bigger boat. The Goldfish of Death is here!"
       - Hedgehog of Death: "Gotta go fast! The Hedgehog of Death is after you!"

3. Test the functionality:
   - Enter play mode
   - Approach Gecco and press E to spawn a boss
   - The dialog should appear with a typewriter effect
   - The dialog text should match the spawned boss
   - The dialog should automatically fade out after 3 seconds

Customization Options:
- You can adjust the typewriter speed, fade speed, and display duration in the DialogManager component
- Add or modify boss-dialog pairs to change which bosses can be spawned and their messages
- Change the spawn distance from player in the GeccoInteraction component
- Make sure your Dialog Container has a CanvasGroup component for fade effects

Troubleshooting:
- If no dialog appears, check that Dialog Container is properly set up with DialogManager
- If a boss spawns but no dialog appears, make sure dialog text is provided for that boss
- If the wrong dialog appears, check that each boss prefab is correctly paired with its intended dialog
