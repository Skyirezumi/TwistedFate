# Setting Up the Animator for SlotMachineUI

Follow these simple steps to create the Animator controller needed for the SlotMachineUI:

## 1. Create the Animator Controller

## 2. Set Up the Basic States

1. Double-click the new controller to open the Animator window
2. Right-click in the States area and select "Create State → Empty"
3. Name it "Idle"
4. Create two more states: "Spin" and "ShowResult"

## 3. Set Up the Parameters

1. In the Parameters tab (left side), click the "+" button
2. Select "Trigger"
3. Name it "Spin"
4. Add another Trigger named "ShowResult"

## 4. Set Up the Transitions

1. Right-click on the "Idle" state and select "Make Transition"
2. Click on the "Spin" state to create a transition
3. Select the transition and in the Inspector:
   - Set Transition Duration to 0.1
   - Check "Has Exit Time" and set Exit Time to 0

4. Right-click on the "Spin" state and select "Make Transition"
5. Click on the "Idle" state to create a transition back
6. Configure similar to the first transition

7. Right-click on the "Idle" state and select "Make Transition"
8. Click on the "ShowResult" state
9. Configure similar to the other transitions

No need to create any animations - this simple state machine will just trigger the appropriate code in the SlotMachineUI script using the trigger parameters.
