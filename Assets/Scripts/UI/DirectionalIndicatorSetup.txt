DIRECTIONAL INDICATOR SETUP GUIDE

This system creates arrows that rotate around the player (or a specified pivot) in world space, pointing toward boss enemies.

1. Create an Arrow Sprite:
   - Create a new GameObject with a sprite renderer component
   - Make sure the arrow sprite points UPWARD (points along positive Y axis)
   - Adjust the scale to fit nicely around the player
   - Save it as a prefab in your project (e.g., in Assets/Prefabs/UI/)

2. Create the DirectionalIndicator Manager:
   - Create an empty GameObject named "DirectionalIndicator" in your scene
   - Add the DirectionalIndicator script to it
   - Configure in the Inspector:
     * Arrow Prefab: Drag your arrow sprite prefab here
     * Indicator Radius: Set how far from the pivot the arrows should appear (default: 1)
     * Vertical Offset: Adjust height of arrows relative to pivot (default: 0.5)
     * Pivot Transform: (Optional) Custom transform around which arrows rotate
       - Leave empty to use the player as the pivot
     * Arrow Angle Offset: Set to -90 if your arrow points up (the default)
       - Adjust this if your arrow sprite points in a different direction

3. Make Bosses Trackable:
   A. Automatic Method (via Gecco spawning):
   - Bosses spawned by Gecco will automatically be registered with the DirectionalIndicator
   - No additional setup needed for bosses spawned by Gecco

   B. Manual Method (for pre-placed bosses):
   - Select any boss GameObject in your scene
   - Add the TrackableEnemy component

4. Test the functionality:
   - Enter play mode
   - Approach Gecco and press E to spawn a boss
   - An arrow should appear around the player/pivot pointing toward the spawned boss
   - The arrow should follow the player and rotate to always point to the boss

Customization Options:
- Change the arrow sprite to a different design
- Adjust the indicator radius to make arrows appear closer or further from pivot
- Modify the vertical offset to adjust the height of the arrows
- Specify a custom pivot transform if you don't want to use the player

Troubleshooting:
- If arrows don't appear, check that the DirectionalIndicator GameObject is active
- Make sure the arrow prefab has a sprite renderer with an assigned sprite
- If arrows point in the wrong direction, adjust the Arrow Angle Offset:
  * For an arrow that points up (↑): use -90
  * For an arrow that points right (→): use 0
  * For an arrow that points down (↓): use 90
  * For an arrow that points left (←): use 180

Note: Since the arrows are positioned in world space, make sure their Z position matches your game's 2D plane.
