GECCO NPC INTERACTION SETUP GUIDE

Follow these steps to set up the Gecco NPC interaction:

1. Select the "Gecco NPC" GameObject in your scene or prefab.

2. Add the GeccoInteraction script to the Gecco NPC GameObject:
   - In the Inspector window, click "Add Component"
   - Search for "GeccoInteraction" and add it

3. Configure the GeccoInteraction script parameters:
   - Interaction Prompt: Drag the "Interaction" child GameObject from Gecco NPC
   - Interaction Range: Set to desired detection distance (default: 3)
   - Spawn Cooldown: Set the cooldown between boss spawns in seconds (default: 10)
   - Boss Prefabs: Add references to your 4 boss prefabs (from Assets/Prefabs/Enemy/Bosses/):
     * Mouse of Death
     * Scorpion of Death
     * Goldfish of Death
     * Hedgehog of Death
   - Spawn Distance From Player: Set distance for boss spawning (default: 5)

4. Make sure the Interaction child object has:
   - A SpriteRenderer component with the "E" key sprite assigned
   - Is positioned above Gecco's head

5. Test the functionality:
   - Enter play mode
   - Approach Gecco - the E prompt should appear
   - Press E to spawn a random boss
   - Check that the cooldown works and prevents spam
   - Verify the boss spawns at a reasonable distance

Note: You can adjust the interaction range by modifying the interactionRange value in the GeccoInteraction script. You can visualize this range in the Scene view (yellow circle) when Gecco is selected.
